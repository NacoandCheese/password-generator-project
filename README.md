I used JavaScript to get the started code to work. Creating conditionals for each prompt, and using for loop to generate random characters and numbers.

# Password Generator

Using JavaScript I created a password generator.

When you click the generate button it presents to you a series of prompts for your password criteria.

When prompted you will be asked for the length of your password that must be more than 8 characters and less than 128.
Other prompts will include your choice of lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers, and special characters.

After selecting from the prompts you click the generate button again the app will generate your new safe and secure password.
